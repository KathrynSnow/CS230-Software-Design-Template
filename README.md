Developed Software Design Paper for client meeting

The Gaming Room client wanted to expand their game, Draw It or Lose It into an app to use on multiple platforms for multiple players.  They wanted unique games with unique names for their users to access from their devices on demand.  I tried to think each step of the process through while writing the document so that as I looked at the code it would follow the thought process of the document.  I think I would revise my comparison of the different platforms.  As we continued through the class I learned little tidbits that I might have added.  I live the designer not considering the users needs and failing to communicate to the user why it isn't possible or wise to accomodate their requests in my public school job.  As I learn more about this topic I see areas where our tech guys could become heros and still be as controlling as needed to protect the system.  I learn that in this role as in all roles you need to communicate what you do because the clients will always respond better with collaboration and understanding why they cannot do 'it that way' but they could do something else.  This can also spur new ideas to get even closer to what the client wants.  This doument to me was an explanation of where we could go and is the perfect instrument to creating better.
